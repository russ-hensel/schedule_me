Purpose: This is a Graphical User Interface Application is to control Schedule operations on a computer running Python.  

* Program  

Enviroment: 
* Program should run on any OS supporting Python 3.6.  
* This should include Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.  
* So far only tested on 
** Windows 
 

Program Status: Beta ). 

Intended for those with some Python experience who can add the files to their Python development environment 
( no install features for this code ). Some dependencies will need to be installed, probably prompted by error messages. 
Editing of the parameter file should be easier for those with Python experience. 
Users should find some useful documentation in the code, this is still a work in progress. 
Much code has been lifted from other projects of mine, some artifacts of the other projects remain.

Guide to Repository

* Root - all code ( src ) required to run the application.  I think it qualifies as pure python ( 3.6 ).  See introduction here for the files containing the "main programs".
* images - coming in future.
* wiki_etc - pdf versions of the wiki at open circuits.  coming..
